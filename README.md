## Project Overview

The **Software Support & User Experience Optimization** project is designed to:

- **Automate Issue Tracking**: Automatically categorize user-reported issues and provide helpful responses.
- **Interactive Software Training**: Generate training materials and video tutorials for new users.
- **Live Troubleshooting Assistance**: Offer live troubleshooting guidance to help resolve common technical issues.
- **Customer Satisfaction Improvement**: Collect and analyze feedback to identify areas for improvement and enhance user experience.

### Components:
1. **Automated Issue Tracking & Response System**: A system that categorizes issues (e.g., login issues, bugs) and provides automated responses to help users quickly.
2. **Interactive Software Training**: Generates HTML-based training materials with embedded tutorials to help new users navigate the software.
3. **Live Troubleshooting Assistance**: Helps users resolve issues in real-time by offering step-by-step troubleshooting guidance.
4. **Customer Feedback Collection & Analysis**: Collects feedback from users, analyzes the feedback, and offers suggestions to improve user satisfaction.

## Features

- **Automated Issue Tracking & Response**: Automatically identifies and responds to common user issues such as login errors, performance issues, and bugs.
- **Interactive Training**: Generates dynamic training materials and tutorials (HTML format) to help users learn how to use the software effectively.
- **Live Troubleshooting**: Provides a series of steps to troubleshoot various issues such as app crashes, slow performance, or bugs.
- **Feedback Analysis**: Collects user feedback and provides insights into areas for improvement, such as bugs, performance, or features.
- **Scalable and Customizable**: Easily extendable to integrate with other support systems or add new troubleshooting and feedback analysis features.

## Installation

### Prerequisites:
- Python 3.x
- Pip package manager

### Steps to Install:
1. Clone this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/Software-Support-User-Experience-Optimization.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd Software-Support-User-Experience-Optimization
    ```

3. Install the required Python dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. If needed, install additional libraries (e.g., NLTK for chatbot or Scikit-learn for machine learning tasks):
    ```bash
    pip install nltk scikit-learn
    ```

## Usage

### Automated Issue Tracking & Response

1. To run the issue tracking system, execute the following code:
    ```bash
    python issue_tracker.py
    ```

2. Example of tracking an issue:
    ```python
    issue = "The page takes too long to load."
    issue_category, response = tracker.track_issue(issue)
    print(f"Issue Category: {issue_category}")
    print(f"Automated Response: {response}")
    ```

### Interactive Software Training

1. Generate interactive HTML-based training materials by running:
    ```bash
    python generate_training_materials.py
    ```

2. This will create an `software_training.html` file that can be opened in any browser. The tutorial includes a video tutorial and key steps to help new users.

### Live Troubleshooting Assistance

1. Run the troubleshooting assistant:
    ```bash
    python troubleshooting_assistant.py
    ```

2. Example of live troubleshooting for a reported issue:
    ```python
    issue = "The app crashes when I try to log in."
    steps = troubleshoot_issue(issue)
    for step in steps:
        print(step)
    ```

### Customer Feedback Collection & Analysis

1. Collect feedback from users and analyze it by running:
    ```bash
    python feedback_analysis.py
    ```

2. Example of feedback analysis:
    ```python
    feedback_system.collect_feedback("The app is slow to load.", 3)
    feedback_system.collect_feedback("Great app, no issues!", 5)
    analysis = feedback_system.analyze_feedback()
    print(analysis)
    ```
